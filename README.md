To run on Ubuntu(Linux) This the OS I use to run my project on, but I did create instruction for Windows below:-->Very Similar

1. click on the file locate-bacon.zip, then you see a icon say open with Archive Manger (default) click ok

2. Extract all files, next:select a destination, choose Desktop click extract

3. Click on Python Shell and Open the file then click on the destination from file in step 2:

4. (Python Shell) In the code, change the path variable: open("/home/*UsersName*/Desktop/locate-bacon/films/"+ filename).read() click save

5. (Python Shell) In the code, change the path variable AGAIN: files = os.listdir("/home/*UsersName*/Desktop/locate-bacon/films/") click save

6. Open up your terminal: Enter the keys---> cd Desktop/locate-bacon It'll put you in the folder.

7. (terminal) Next enter the keys:  python lets_play_KB.py "Will Smith" --> "Enter actor or actress name"

8. (If you want too!!) The tool will take multiple arguments as well if you want to search a few at once.
i.e. python lets_play_KB.py "Will Smith" "Denzel Washington" "Brad Pitt"
